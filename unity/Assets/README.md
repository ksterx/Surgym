# nvidia-flex-for-unity

An unofficial reposity for the NVIDIA Flex plugin/demo(s) for Unity.

NVIDIA Flex is a bunch of physics systems built for Unity by NVIDIA.

My own notes:
Seems to work with even non-NVIDIA based devices (Intel, AMD, and so on). I wouldn't suggest trying to build for mobile or older devices though, as Flex seems to be pretty heavy on performance. It also seems to work with even the newest versions (2021 LTS, 2022.1, etc), though I'm not sure if it works properly on HDRP or URP, as I personally could only get a stable FPS when running it on the built-in pipeline, as I'm using a lower-end PC. You might get a few compiler errors in newer versions of Unity, but you can fix them by just deleting the mentioned scripts in the errors and it should work still fine.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. Download the reposity as a .zip file, and extract it once you're done downloading.

2. Open your Unity project, and drop the following files in to your asset folder; Actors, Assets, Auxiliary, Editor, Helpers, Native, & Resources.

3. (optional) Drop the Flex Samples folder to your assets folder if you want to experiment with already created examples.

*NOTE:* If you already have an Editor folder in your project, open the folder before importing and only import the following folders; Editors & Tests to your existing Unity Editor folder.

You also can't have two folders with the same name, so if you already have a folder in-engine with the same name as any of the mentioned folders, rename the existing ones or the ones that you're importing.

Here is the water example that is included in the rep:

WORKS ONLY WITH UNITY - THIS IS THE UNITY VERSION OF NVIDIA FLEX

**DISCLAIMER:**

I am not saying that I own Flex, or the rights to it. I am here to merely distribute the package. Flex was removed from the Unity Asset Store a while back, and it was pretty hard to get your hands on it after that happened. I managed to find a download to it, and decided to share it with the world once again as I think that it's quite an interesting package.

[The license in this reposity was taken from the official NVIDIA reposity for the downloadable Flex demo]

You are not allowed to use *this* plugin of Flex commercially, but you should be allowed to try to find other ways of getting Flex working in Unity.

THIS IS ONLY FOR RESEARCH AND TESTING PURPOSES.

Thanks, and have fun! - "Tespinen", or Timi.
